# D3-Challenge

In this task, I created a static and a dynamic scatter plot by using D3 techniques to visualize the health risks facing particular demographics 
based on the dataset from from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

## Basic D3 Dabbler (Static Scatter Plot)

* Create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age
* Include state abbreviations in the circles.
* Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

## Dymamic Scatter Plot

Include more demographics and more risk factors. Place additional labels in your scatter plot and give them click events so that your users can decide which data to display. Animate the transitions for your circles' locations as well as the range of your axes. Do this for two risk factors for each axis. Or, for an extreme challenge, create three for each axis.
